# Episode 8
Learning about skybox, the player is placed in the center of a massive cube. The sky primitive adds a background color or 360° image to a scene. A sky is a large sphere with a color or texture mapped to the inside. Therefore objects will be rendered ontop of the skybox and the skybox will always be in the middle. The color attribute adds color to only the background (as shown in the example).
